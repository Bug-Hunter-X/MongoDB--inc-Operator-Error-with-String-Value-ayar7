# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB updates. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specific value.  However, if a non-numerical value is provided, the update will fail. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.
